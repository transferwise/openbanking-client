Java client for using the Open Banking API, exposed by an ASPSP, as a TPP. The library supports a subset of the full 
API:  

- Support for version 3.2 [dynamic client registration](https://openbankinguk.github.io/dcr-docs-pub/v3.2/dynamic-client-registration.html)
- Support for version 3.1.6 [single immediate domestic payments](https://openbankinguk.github.io/read-write-api-site3/v3.1.6/profiles/payment-initiation-api-profile.html)
- Support for version 3.1.9 [variable recurring payments API](https://openbankinguk.github.io/read-write-api-site3/v3.1.9/profiles/vrp-profile.html)
- Support for the following OAuth client authentication methods
    - Mutual TLS
    - Private key JWT
    - Client secret basic
    - Client secret post

## Example Usage

### Client Registration

```java
//
// Step 1 - configure the RegistrationClient instance to use for the ASPSP
//

TppConfiguration tppConfiguration = TppConfiguration.builder()
    // set the properties acording to your organisation
    .build();
// configure the SSL context of the instance according to your setup, including a KeyManager to support mutual TLS on
// conections to ASPSP and a TrustManager to support connections to ASPSPs using OB issued certificates
RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

// an example implementation might look up the values to supply from a KeyStore
KeySupplier signingKeySupplier = new ExampleKeySupplier();
JsonConverter jsonConverter = new JacksonJsonConverter();
JwtClaimsSigner jwtClaimsSigner = new JwtClaimsSigner(signingKeySupplier, jsonConverter);

RegistrationClient registrationClient = new RestRegistrationClient(jwtClaimsSigner, restTemplate);

RegistrationRequestService registrationRequestService = new RegistrationRequestService(keySupplier, tppConfiguration);

// supplies the details of the ASPSP implementation required to make the API calls
AspspDetails aspspDetails = new ExampleAspspDetails();

// 
// Step 2 - register with the ASPSP
// 

ClientRegistrationRequest clientRegistrationRequest = registrationRequestService.generateRegistrationRequest(
        softwareStatement, 
        aspspDetails);

ClientRegistrationResponse clientRegistrationResponse = registrationClient.registerClient(clientRegistrationRequest, 
        aspspDetails);
```

### V3 Payments

```java
//
// Step 1 - configure the V3 PaymentClient instance to use for the ASPSP
//

TppConfiguration tppConfiguration = TppConfiguration.builder()
    // set the properties acording to your organisation
    .build();
// configure the SSL context of the instance according to your setup, including a KeyManager to support mutual TLS on
// conections to ASPSP and a TrustManager to support connections to ASPSPs using OB issued certificates
RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

ClientAuthentication tlsClientAuthentication = new TlsAuthentication();
OAuthClient restOAuthClient = new RestOAuthClient(tlsClientAuthentication, restTemplate);

// an example implementation might use the EndToEndIdentification of the request as the idempotency key 
IdempotencyKeyGenerator idempotencyKeyGenerator = new ExampleIdempotencyKeyGenerator();

// an example implementation might look up the values to supply from a KeyStore
KeySupplier signingKeySupplier = new ExampleKeySupplier();
JsonConverter jsonConverter = new JacksonJsonConverter();
JwtClaimsSigner jwtClaimsSigner = new JwtClaimsSigner(signingKeySupplier, jsonConverter);

PaymentClient paymentClient = new RestPaymentClient(restTemplate,
    jsonConverter,
    restOAuthClient,
    idempotencyKeyGenerator,
    jwtClaimsSigner);

// supplies the details of the ASPSP implementation required to make the API calls
AspspDetails aspspDetails = new ExampleAspspDetails();

// 
// Step 2 - initiate the payment
// 

// set the properties according to the payment attempt
OBWriteDomesticConsent4 paymentConsentRequest = new OBWriteDomesticConsent4();
OBWriteDomesticConsentResponse5 paymentConsentResponse = paymentClient.createDomesticPaymentConsent(
    paymentConsentRequest, 
    aspspDetails);

// 
// Step 3 - redirect the user to the ASPSP authorisation site to authorise the payment 
// 
// on authorisation success, an authorization code is received from the ASPSP
// note, when building the ASPSP authorisation URL, the JwtClaimsSigner can be used to generate the request parameter
//  

//
// Step 4 - submit the payment for execution
//

//
// Step 4a (optional) - check for sufficient funds on the source account 
//

OBWriteFundsConfirmationResponse1 fundsConfirmationResponse = paymentClient.getFundsConfirmation(consentId, 
    authorizationCode, 
    aspspDetails);

// set the properties according to the payment attempt
OBWriteDomestic2 paymentRequest = new OBWriteDomestic2();
OBWriteDomesticResponse5 paymentResponse = paymentClient.createDomesticPayment(paymentRequest, 
    authorizationCode, 
    aspspDetails);
